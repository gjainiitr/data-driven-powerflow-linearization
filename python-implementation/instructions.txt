Forward - MAPE (V, Va -> P,Q) -> Different bus system, Numerical values
Inverse - MAE (P,Q -> V, Va) -> Different bus systems, Numerical values

Different models and techniques -> Error
1. Matlab -> Python (gopal) -> 30 bus systems, MAPE, MAE -> other bus systems
2. ANN model evaluation (suraj) -> 30 bus system, MAPE, MAE -> other bus sytems

(*) Complete model train+test -> low error
(*) Train-test-split -> high error

Goal:
1. (Every model) * (forward(mape) + inverse(mae)) * ((with tts) + (without tts)) * (ann + ols + pls + blr + random_forest) -> Excel sheet (analyse)
2. ANN - error vs. (no. of eg/no. of bus) - (different data size) * (different bus systems) -> Plot (analyse)
3. High bus systems -> repeat (30 -> 3000) -> ML Lab (Dept.)


Current:
Implement Bayesian Ridge/ARD Regression (any one) wrt single column training.
Add intercept in the coef. matrix
Implement Random Forest and Linear SVM
